Place all project media inside per-project folders under this directory.

For each project, use this structure:
- assets/projects/<project-slug>/images/   # PNG/JPG screenshots
- assets/projects/<project-slug>/videos/   # MP4/WebM screen recordings

Recommended filenames:
- cover.png (main thumbnail)
- screen-1.png, screen-2.png, ...
- demo.mp4 (optional)

Update paths in src/data/projects.ts if you change names.
